# Example application "HTML forms"

We will learn about SourceAmazing and code generation with a short tutorial 
where we will create some HTML forms.

# The three parts of code generation

When generating code, you always have to cover three parts:
1. The _schema_ what data is supported as input information. 
2. The _definitions_ with the essential input information.
3. The _templates_ to fill in the definition data into the placeholders 
and the _filepaths_ where to write the filled-out templates.

Learn about that by starting the step-by-step tutorial [here](01-the-example-project.md)
